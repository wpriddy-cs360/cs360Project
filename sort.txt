There are multiple ways to sort in Java. Most common are the types such as bubble sorting, insertion sorting,
merge sorting, and selection sorting. These all work differently, and each come with their strengths and weaknesses,
mostly stemming from how effecient, or not, they are. None of these are built into Java however, the one that is
only works with arrays, and only sorts smallest to largest. It is the Arrays.sort() method, and while useful does
have its drawbacks, as mentioned before.

Example:

import java.util.Arrays;

public class arrayEx
{
	int[] toSort = { 8, 23, 54, 1, 39, 87, 101 };

	Arrays.sort(toSort);

	System.out.printf("Modified arr[] : %s", Arrays.toString(arr));
}

This would print the sorted array: Modified arr[] : [1, 8, 23, 39, 54, 87, 101]
