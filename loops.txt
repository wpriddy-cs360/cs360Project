<h1>Loops</h1>
<h2>Level 1</h2>
<p>There are two basic kinds of loops, for and while.
For loops are used when you know how many times you want to repeat,
and while loops are used when you want to run the loop based off
of some condition </p>
<code> for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {</br>
//commands to be repeated</br>
} </code>
<p> In this example, a for loop is creaated. A variable i is
created and set equal to zero. The loop will run, increasing the value of
i each time by 1. The loop will end when i is equal to 10.</p>
<code> int k = 0;</br>

while(k < 10) {</br>
//commands to be repeated</br>
k++;</br>
}</code>
<p> This is a while loop, in a while loop, the code runs as long as
the conditon (k < 10) is true. You may notice that we have to manually
update the value of k in the loop. The while loop will run forever if
k is not updated.</p>
<h3>Quiz 1</h3>
<p>Create a while loop that adds together the integers 0-3.</p>
<br>
<button onclick="answer1()">Answer</button>
<p id="answer1"></p>
<script>
function answer1() {
  document.getElementById("answer1").innerHTML = "int i = 0;<br>int total = 0;<br>while(i < 4){<br>total = total + i;<br>i++;<br>}";
}
</script>

 <h2>Level 2</h2>
 <p> It is possible to have nested loops, which means a loop
inside of a loop. In this situatation, the entire inner loop
is run for each repetion of the outer loop <p>
<code> for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {</br>
                        int i = 0;</br>
                        while(i < 5) {</br>
System.out.println("This will be printed
when j equals " + j + " and when i equals " + i);</br>
i++;</br>
}</br>
}</code>
<h3>Quiz 2</h3>
<p>Create a while loop within a while loop that adds together the integers 0-3 and doubles the total sum.</p>
<br>
<button onclick="answer2()">Answer</button>
<p id="answer2"></p>
<script>
function answer2() {
  document.getElementById("answer2").innerHTML = "int j = 0;<br>int total1 = 0;<br>int total2 = 0;<br>while(j < 2){<br>int i = 0;<br>while(i < 4){<br>total2 = total2 +$
}
</script>
